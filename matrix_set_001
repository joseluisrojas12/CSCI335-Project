This example matrix input file conforms to the specification indicated in the 
project specification. It should be able to be read as-is. These first several
lines are skipped when parsing this matrix input file. The first matrix is a
2x3 matrix having the form

2 1 5
1 3 2

Here is that matrix:

NUM_MATRICES 3
NUM_ROWS 2
NUM_COLUMNS 3
2
1
5
1
3
2

Notice that comments can occur in between matrices. Above was the first matrix.
Here is the second matrix. Notice that the specification allows for the number 
of columns and the number of rows to be specified in either order, as long as
the one occurs immediately after the other, plus the elements of the matrix
occur immediate after the number of columns and rows is specified.

NUM_COLUMNS 2
NUM_ROWS 3
3
4
-1
2

The last matrix given is the product of the first two. If your program successfully
multiplied the above two matrices then the results output file would be identical to the
lines given below.

NUM_ROWS 2
NUM_COLUMNS 2
